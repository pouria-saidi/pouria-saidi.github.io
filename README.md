<h2 id="section1"> About me</h2>
<p>
I am currently a Research Fellow in the Department of Neurology at Mayo Clinic, Arizona, working with Dr. Oana Dumitrascu on early detection and risk modeling of Preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Prior to that, I was a postdoc at Arizona State University, where I explored responsible machine learning methods with Dr. Visar Berisha and Gautam Dasarathy. I completed my Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida.
