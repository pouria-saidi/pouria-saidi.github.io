<h2 id="section1"> About me</h2>
<p>
I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering at the Arizona State University where I got the opportunity to work with Dr. Visar Berisha and Dr. Gautam Dasarathy. I received my Ph.D. at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Central Florida.
